# CryptoClustering Homework Overview

## Project Objective
In this homework assignment, you will explore unsupervised learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data. The goal is to predict how cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour and 7-day price changes using clustering methods.

## Key Components
- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess cryptocurrency market data.
- **Normalization**: Use `StandardScaler` to normalize the data for better clustering performance.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Implement K-Means to group cryptocurrencies based on price changes and determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and analyze the explained variance of the principal components.
- **Visualization**: Create scatter plots to visualize the clusters and compare results from the original data and PCA data.
